So I recently ran LLM on my phone. [Andrej
Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy) create this awesome
repo called [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c). I tried to run
this on my buget android, made tweet about. It went mini viral I say. And I
also received reply from legend himself .

This is blog I'll go over how did I do it and how can you replicate to

## Brief about llama.2c

[llama2.c ](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) has one
single c file to inference llama modes. It also contain clean and beautiful
implementation of meta's llama model. Watch [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=1678s)
on nanoGPT. Llama code is little different but you can understand it.

### Running it on Android

Since llama.c is single c file with no dependency is fairly easy to compile.
So thought lets run it on android. I have moto g62 buget android phone (about
$185).

### Termux

[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) is an open-
source Android application that provides a powerful Linux command line
environment. It simulates linux system that you can run anything be it python,
c or go. This is not full linux It has lot of limitations.

### Installtion:

You need to install F-droid ( open source alternative for playstore) and
install termux from their ->
[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)

_DO NOT INSTALL TERMUX FROM PLAYSTORE (its deprecated)_

Ones it install you will see familiar bash termux. Termux has its own package
manager `pkg`. don't run of wild yet. (Fancy autocomplete at the end)

First run cammand `termux-change-repo`, Select ok, Then change mirror to
Default host with CloudFlare, defalut repo is not working so you have to
change it to mirror, try diffrent mirrors if cloud flare doesnâ€™t work.

After This do

```bash
pkg update # Just press enter is any prompt comes up
pkg upgrade #just press enter is any prompt comes up
pkg install -y clang git wget openssl vim
```

Now Clone llama2.c

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c.git
```

cd into it

`cd llama2.c`

Now Donlaod The Model weights.

```bash
wget https://karpathy.ai/llama2c/model44m.bin -P out44m
```

Now We Compile and run it

Compile :

```bash
clang -Ofast -fopenmp -march=native run.c -lm -o run
```

(gcc is not supported in temux must use clang)

Run it ðŸš€

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 ./run out44m/model44m.bin
```

Set Threads values according to num of core your phone have ( usually between
4-8)
