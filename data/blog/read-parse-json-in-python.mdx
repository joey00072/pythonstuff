Whether it if the response from the API, or configuration of text editor you will probably have encountered json file.

## Reading Json file in python

Reading json file is as easy as any other file.

```python

f = open('file.json')
json_text = f.read()
f.close()

print(json_text)
```

Although above methoed is complely valid it is not recomanded.
use context manager instade.

```python

with open('file.json') as f:
    json_text = f.read()

print(json_text)
```

This gives json as a string which is not useful by itself. We need to parse it.

## Pasaring Json in python

Luckily parsing json is very easy in python. Python has inbuilt module conveniently named json.
Calling its load method will return dict.
Accessing data with key value pair is much convenient.

```python
import json
# sample json str

json_text='{"name":"Joey"}'

json_dict=json.loads(json_text)

print(json_dict)

```

## Creating Json with dict

creatring json is easy to. We have provide dict to dump
method in json moudle.

```python
import json

json_dict={
            "name":"Joey"
           }

json_text=json.dumps(json_dict)

print(json_text)

# if you want write into file
with open('file.json','w') as f:
	f.write(json_text)
```
