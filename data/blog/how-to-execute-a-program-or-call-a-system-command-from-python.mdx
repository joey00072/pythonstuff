Python comes with inbuilt subprocess modules. While the subprocess module has various functions. We can use it to spawn other process from python (ie. run other programs/ commands).

#running ls command : note switches ls->dir for windows
subprocess.run(["ls"])

#running ls command : Not for windows
subprocess.run(["ls",'-al'])

```

In this way we can run, we can run system command from python.
