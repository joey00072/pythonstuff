## Brief about

CSV stands for comma-separated values. It is used to store tables in file. CSV file are
same as text file, first line of this file usually conatin name of columns and each row
conatiner respected values
[here](https://blog.sqlizer.io/posts/csv-history/#:~:text=The%20IBM%20Fortran%20first%20supported%20CSV%20files%20in%201972.&text=%E2%80%8B%20This%20was%20largely%20to,prone%20to%20producing%20incorrect%20results.).

There are lot of ways to load csv file in python. Here we are going to discuss main two.
Lets start with Python's in built csv module.

<br />

## CSV Module

(Secound Methoed is Better)

<br />
Pyhton provide builtin module called `csv` so we dont need to install anything. In this methoed
first we have to open file as any other files in python. Than we pass this file to csv reader for
parsing. which giver iterator(something we can loop over) which has ordered Dict as its entry read
more about csv

```python
import csv

#open
with open('BTC-USD.csv','r') as csv_file:
    csv_iter = csv.DictReader(csv_file)

    for line in csv_iter:
        print(line)

    #optional you can convert iterator
    #into list if you dont like it

    lst = list(csv_iter)

```

## Pandas

This is the best way to work with csv file. For this you need
pandas module. If you dont have it you can easily install it with
pip. Type folloing cammond in terminal/cmd

```
python3 -m pip install pandas
```

now

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('BTC-USD.csv')

print(df)

```

**Note** Pandas read csv methoed return pandas dataframe object. Dont worry it is just like
fancy array

With pandas writing to csv file is easy to.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('BTC-USD.csv')

df.to_csv('new_file.csv')

```
