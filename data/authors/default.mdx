Hey, it's Joey!

I'm a indie ai dev. And engineer at heart ❤️, passionate about building AI and is on a mission to create my own Jarvis. My world revolves around programming, creating, breaking, and learning from things!.
On the quieter side of life, you'll find me strumming my guitar or diving deep into quantum physics. Despite being a bit of an introvert (at least that's what my friends say), I really enjoy meeting and chatting with new people.

If you wanna chat here is my twitter [@shxf0072](https://twitter.com/shxf0072) <br></br>
